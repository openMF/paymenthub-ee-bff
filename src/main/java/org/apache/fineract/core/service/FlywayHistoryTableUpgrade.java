/**
 * Moves a Flyway 2.x history table to the layout Flyway 10 expects.
 *
 * The old app ran Flyway 2.x, which kept its history in a table called
 * "schema_version". Flyway 10 uses "flyway_schema_history" and a different
 * layout: "installed_rank" is the primary key, the old "version_rank" column is
 * gone, "description" is NOT NULL and "version" is nullable. Flyway 10 can read
 * the old table but cannot insert into it, so the first pending migration on an
 * existing database fails. Flyway used to do this conversion by itself (up to
 * Flyway 4), that code was removed, so we do it here before calling migrate().
 *
 * The old table is COPIED, never renamed or dropped: "schema_version" is left
 * exactly as it was. That matters for two reasons beyond keeping a backup.
 *
 * First, this application is not always the only thing using the schema. The build
 * being replaced is one of them: on gazelle the deployed image is still a Flyway 2
 * build, so during and after a rollout "schema_version" is a live table, not a
 * leftover. paymenthub-ee-auth reads the same schemas as well.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. An earlier version of this class renamed the table, and
 * running that build on gazelle took the history away from the deployed one: on the
 * next restart Flyway 2 found no "schema_version", created a fresh one and
 * baselined it, so the tenant schemas went from a 44-row history to a 2-row one and
 * the old build believed schemas that are at version 44 were at version 2. It would
 * have replayed 42 migrations over objects that already exist. Recovered from the
 * backup table, but nothing about it was visible until a restart.
 *
 * Second, it makes the conversion reversible. Rolling an image back to a Flyway 2
 * build finds its history where it left it.
 *
 * Does nothing on a fresh database, and nothing if it has already run: the check
 * for "flyway_schema_history" comes first, so a second start is a no-op. Nothing
 * here removes "schema_version", so there is no window in which neither table
 * exists and no interrupted state to recover from.
 *
 * Copying is not enough to make this app safe on a schema it does not own - the
 * migration numbers still collide, see the comment in
 * TenantDatabaseUpgradeService - but it does mean the collision damages only this
 * app and not the one that owns the schema.
 *
 * How a failure here surfaces depends on which schema it happens in, and the two
 * are not the same. TenantDatabaseUpgradeService.flywayDefaultSchema() lets the
 * exception escape, so a problem in the core schema stops startup. Its
 * flywayTenants() loop catches Exception per tenant and only logs it, so on a
 * tenant schema a failure degrades to one ERROR line: the context starts, the
 * readiness probe goes green and that tenant serves traffic against a schema whose
 * migration state is unknown. The catch predates this class and widening it is a
 * startup-behaviour decision for a multi-tenant deployment, not something to change
 * inside a migration - but anyone reading this should know it can be swallowed.
